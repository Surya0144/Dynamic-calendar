## Usage

```jsx
import { EventCalendar, type CalendarEvent } from "@/components/event-calendar";

function App() {
  const [events, setEvents] = useState([]);

  const handleEventAdd = (event) => {
    setEvents([...events, event]);
  };

  const handleEventUpdate = (updatedEvent) => {
    setEvents(events.map((event) => (event.id === updatedEvent.id ? updatedEvent : event)));
  };

  const handleEventDelete = (eventId) => {
    setEvents(events.filter((event) => event.id !== eventId));
  };

  return (
    <EventCalendar
      events={events}
      onEventAdd={handleEventAdd}
      onEventUpdate={handleEventUpdate}
      onEventDelete={handleEventDelete}
      initialView="month"
    />
  );
}
```

## View Modes

### Month View

Displays a traditional month calendar with events. Events that span multiple days are properly displayed across the days they span.

### Week View

Shows a detailed week view with hour slots. Events are positioned according to their time and can span multiple days.

### Day View

Provides a detailed view of a single day with hour slots. Perfect for seeing all events scheduled for a specific day.

### Agenda View

Lists all events in a chronological list format, making it easy to see upcoming events at a glance.

## Limitations and Known Issues

This calendar component is in early alpha stage and is not recommended for production use. There are several limitations and issues that need to be addressed:

### Drag and Drop Limitations

- In month view, only the first day of multi-day events is draggable
- In week and day views, multi-day events are placed in an "All day" section at the top of the view and are not draggable
- Some drag and drop operations may not update the event data correctly in certain edge cases

### Visual and UX Issues

- Limited responsiveness on very small screens
- Event overlapping is not handled optimally in some views
- Limited keyboard navigation support
- Accessibility features are incomplete

### Technical Limitations

- Limited testing across different browsers and devices
- Performance may degrade with a large number of events
- Time zone support is limited
- No recurring event support
- No integration with external calendars (Google, Outlook, etc.)

### Other Considerations

- The component has not undergone extensive testing
- Error handling is minimal
